            <h2>Reflection on Internet and Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                The internet technologies and web development principles have become deeply understandable to me throughout this semester. The education about 
              website operations revealed fundamental principles to me. Each part of HTML leads with the core functions of CSS and JavaScript which unite to 
              generate fully operational web applications. Additionally, I explored tools like I use GitHub as my version control system combined with hosting
              capabilities that prove essential for my project development. My experience has developed my problem-solving abilities at a higher level. My learning
              has provided both skills to create self-sufficient sites and independence when deploying and managing web projects. My dedication to learn and use 
              these skills will continue in future work.
