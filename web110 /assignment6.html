    <p>This activity told me a lot about fundamental computer network concepts together with network functioning as well as their multiple applications. A computer network operates as a
    device connectivity platform for data resource and hardware distribution purposes. Computer networks exist in multiple sizes starting from private small local area networks
    (LANs) through to expansive global networks including the internet. The lesson included teaching students about various network design structures while instructing them about
    transmission methods together with the distinctions between cabled and wireless systems. Throughout the activity I understood both the format of computer network systems and how
    devices transmit information through packet data transmission. Data packets include an information-rich header section and the actual content stored inside the payload section.
    The lesson revealed the existence of PANs (Personal Area Networks) in addition to LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks) as fundamental network categories.
      
    I learned essential differences between wired and wireless networks based on their benefits and limitations during the class. In wired networks users gain better speed and security
    compared to wireless networks that enable them to move around freely because of their convenience. I can effectively improve the organization of and troubleshoot my home or office
    networks because of my knowledge about networking types and topologies. The understanding of Wi-Fi principles and boundary conditions enables me to establish a stable home network 
    system. My future job tasks will benefit from this concept through workplace network optimization and data-sharing security recommendations along with hybrid wired and wireless connection
    suggestions for superior performance.</p>
