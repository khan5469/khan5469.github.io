    <p>I finished the Facebook tutorial as part of the GCFLearnFree program. Through this activity I learned the complete process of building and configuring a Facebook account.
    The Facebook tutorial showed me how to add friends along with post creation and group membership application as well as privacy setting adjustments. The educational material
    described Facebook's capability to maintain social connections through friend relationships and to both present updates and serve as an advertising platform for events or businesses.
    I will use Facebook as a professional networking tool to join groups and contact colleagues and inform them about my career advancements. Facebook serves as an excellent platform which
    allows users to monitor their community events. 
    The LinkedIn Basics tutorial was also finished by me. Through this activity I learned the steps for building my professional LinkedIn profile along with networking techniques for connecting
    with colleagues while presenting my abilities to them. Through LinkedIn I discovered two main uses: the capability to find employment through its job search system and the ability to link with
    professional communities and construct professional contacts. I will adopt LinkedIn as my platform to interact with business contacts and broadcast my accomplishments while pursuing new employment
    possibilities. The connections I make through LinkedIn will provide career support for my professional advancement while keeping me updated on my field of work.</p>
