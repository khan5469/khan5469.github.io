    <p>Assignment 2 (Web Browsers) While doing the activity of saving a webpage I figured out how to file web content for offline use. On this page, I learned the process of going to the "File" menu,
    selecting "Save As," and then your save type, like "Webpage, Complete" or "HTML only". I also found out the importance of picking the right encoding and where the files
    are to make the webpage live. In particular, as the physical world also exists offline, this skill is very useful for storing important reference material or resources 
    that predominantly exist outside of the internet, but which may not always be easily accessible online. In today's world I can use this knowledge to save research
    articles or instructional guides for later offline review. I see myself using this skill in future in professional environments, such as when compiling web based reports so
    that they can be accessed offline or saving key resources to presentations or training sessions in event such environments are not online.
    Adding to and sorting out favorites gave me the knowledge on how to save and classifying regularly visited websites. I learned how to add a webpage to my favorites list, 
    assign a name and put into folders. Not only it saves time, but also checks for important resources which can be accessed with ease. Categorizing favorites with the creation
    of folders for personal, academic or work related sites enables me to maintain an well structured collection of bookmarks. Right now though, I have these pieces of knowledge 
    applied to hack the web browsing experience if I am managing a few online tools or resources to accomplish academic tasks. This skill can also be useful in the future, to help
    organize client websites, team collaboration platforms or other frequently used tools which increases productivity and reduces waste of time.Practical skills to organize and 
    manage online information were what I learnt with these activities.</p>
