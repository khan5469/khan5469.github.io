    <p>The lesson discusses computer graphics and multimedia operations that appear on web pages. The text describes two graphic types: raster graphics
compose pixels and vector graphics compose shapes and lines. Vector images maintain their sharp appearance at all dimensions thus making them effective
for printing purposes because they do not share raster images' resolution dependency which leads to diminished picture quality upon size modification.
The session shows students how to employ multimedia elements through their combination of text format alongside audio materials and image files as well
as animated components and video content. Interface features embedded in multimedia tools improve online page interactions as well as user engagement levels.
Audios can be included in web pages through the audio tag whereas videos need either the video tag or embedded YouTube videos with the iframe tag.
Web development allows multimedia content to play in real-time streaming but also supports downloading the content for later use. Internet speed together with compatibility issues can limit streaming procedures. Multimedia and graphics find applications across education fields along with entertainment sectors and advertising industry.
The lesson demonstrates how to use GIMP or Inkscape along with other tools for raster and vector image building and modification. The lesson teaches the correct usage of the img tag in web pages and explains that this tag needs both a src source value and an alt alternative text value. The instruction shows how to add video and audio components by defining their supported file types and formats for optimal compatibility.
The lesson enables students to master effective graphical and multimedia techniques which enhance user-friendly web page development.
