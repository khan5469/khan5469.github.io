    <p>In session 7, I went through an Internet security activity that taught me essential practices to protect myself online. The lesson presented the main online dangers that include viruses together with
    phishing attempts and spyware and ransomware attacks. I comprehend how phishing scams manipulate users to give away sensitive information as well as how spyware temporarily monitors activities
    and ransomware denies computer access unless users pay a ransom. The lesson taught me about two fundamental security tools including firewalls that prevent dangerous internet traffic and antivirus
    programs that track and eliminate dangerous programs. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) proved key in account security because it demands authentication beyond passwords such as verification through
    mobile phone codes.
    Undergoing this activity exposed me to the need for taking initiative regarding safeguarding my online presence. After learning these security measures I will put them into practice to secure both myself
    and my online accounts. A password manager will serve as my tool to generate and save powerful authentication codes. The implementation of MFA for my accounts with the added security measure and a practice
    to avoid both dangerous links and dubious emails represents my next action. Using these steps will make me safer while online together with offering helpful information to others at home and eventually in
    my future work career.</p>
