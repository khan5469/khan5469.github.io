    <title>Assignment 15a- Resumes and LinkedIn profile</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I studied several types of résumés through the writing activity such as reverse chronological and functional alongside hybrid and blind and infographic/video
    formats. The reverse chronological résumé stands as the standard preference under 2024 employment criteria because it shows professional development effectively.
    The evolution of applicant tracking systems (ATS) as well as artificial intelligence (AI) in labor market selection has forced candidates to adopt a process of
    keyword optimization and basic formatting for retrieving ATS system compatibility. An important lesson taught me how a master résumé allows candidates to produce
    customized applications for multiple job roles speedily.
    This knowledge will guide my future job searches because I will make my résumé ATS-compliant while using either reverse chronological order or the hybrid format
    for different positions. My agenda consists of using appropriate keywords besides emphasizing my qualifications through achievements which demonstrate suitability
    for each opening. I plan to develop my professional digital resume through these concepts into a version that maximizes online recruitment platform and AI
    recruitment system compatibility. The strategic format selection will boost my appeal in competitive hiring while improving my likelihood of finding purposeful
    employment opportunities.Below is my LinkedIn profile www.linkedin.com/in/ayaan-khan-47762828a</p>
