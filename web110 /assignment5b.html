    <title>In this session I discovered different Internet communication services including Voice over IP (VoIP) together with file transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and remote desktop applications
    during my study this week. Such technologies enable quick communication with file sharing capabilities as well as providing remote control access to computers. For my research I studied File
    Transfer Protocol together with its secure variant FTPS while understanding why data security is vital during file transfers. During my Internet video research I examined peer-to-peer file-sharing
    safety hazards and acquired knowledge on remote desktop solutions that enhance teamwork and operational efficiency. My activity involved practical usage of the FTP demo server located at
    https://dlptest.com/ftp-test/. I used FileZilla FTP client on the demo FTP server to investigate its functions while practicing file transfers based on the given log-in details. Using FTP to transfer
    files remains simple yet insecure when encryption is absent from the model (similar to FTPS). The obtained knowledge permits work file transfer and resource sharing with colleagues. The future use of
    FTP will enable me to safely manage server files and update website content. Participating in the hands-on activity established my ability to work with file transfer protocols.</title>
