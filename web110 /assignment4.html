    <p>Session four Emails, covered the complete overview of email client operations which includes how these clients fetch and keep emails while they use protocols and encryption technology.
    The activity analyzed the distinctions between computers running email programs and online email services and the communication network protocols POP3, IMAP and SMTP which provide server-client
    connection capabilities. The activity provided insight into how email client software operates by showing its functionality for writing messages and fetching emails followed by server-submission
    activities. Users can retrieve remote server emails by using POP3 or IMAP protocols but IMAP offers better multi-device access compared to the basic local email storage of POP3. Through study I
    gained understanding of SMTP email transmission along with encryption requirements that secure both communication sessions through SSL/TLS and email body integrity through S/MIME or OpenPGP. The
    lesson described both benefits and drawbacks of hosting email servers regarding accessibility and privacy and explained the contrasts between webmail and traditional email interfaces. The educational
    material introduced proprietary protocols with Microsoft MAPI as an example while explaining the designated port numbers email systems use for communication. Insightful information emerged about the
    standards RFC 6409 and RFC 5068 regarding their roles in maintaining secure email submission with consistent protocols.</p>
