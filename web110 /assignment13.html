            <h2>Reflection on the Assignment</h2>
            <p>
                Completing this assignment taught me the importance of effective project management in ensuring the successful completion of tasks. By creating
              the Gantt chart, I learned how to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks with clear timelines. This approach not only helps in
              tracking progress but also ensures accountability and efficient use of resources. The process of visualizing my project timeline provided clarity
              on the steps required and highlighted potential challenges. Moving forward, I will apply these project management skills in both academic and
              professional environments to manage deadlines, allocate resources effectively, and achieve goals systematically.
