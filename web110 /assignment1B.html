    <p>Assignment 1- Internet Fundamentals (Introduction to internet) The first activity I completed was the "Git Quick Guide." In this activity, I explored the basics of Git,
      including its core concepts such as version control, branching, merging, and how to work with remote repositories. I learned how to initialize a 
      Git repository, stage and commit changes, and push updates to a remote repository such as GitHub. Additionally, I practiced creating and managing
      branches to isolate feature development and merge them back into the main branch. By completing this activity, I gained a solid understanding of 
      how Git can streamline collaboration and maintain a project's history, which is essential for effective software development. The second activity
      I completed was "File basics," which focused on understanding how to work with files and folders. This activity explained the basics
      of creating, moving, renaming, and deleting files and folders on a macOS system. I learned how to use Finder to organize and manage files efficiently,
      as well as how to select multiple files using keyboard shortcuts like Command and Shift. Additionally, I practiced creating new folders, moving files
      into them, and creating shortcuts for quick access. This activity helped me understand the importance of maintaining an organized file system and
      provided me with practical skills to navigate and manage files on my computer effectively.</p>
