    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I learned a lot from this weeks session like For example, The tables Customers, Orders and Products provided me with skills to extract beneficial
        data while uncovering connected relationships. I focused my practice on retrieving particular details between product specifications and customer
        demand and staff anniversary records. The instruction covered both the calculation of total costs and the method of sorting data. I developed essential
        skills to handle databases that will benefit my work in future projects involving information management and data questions. I will definitely use this 
        skills to enhance my career further and to make my customers happy.
