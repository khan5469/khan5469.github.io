    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="summary">
        Completing the Northwind database activities helped me understand the relationships between tables in a database, such as primary and foreign key relationships. I learned how junction tables like `OrderDetails` and `EmployeeTerritories` connect multiple tables and how composite keys work. This exercise emphasized the importance of designing normalized databases for efficient data retrieval and management. These concepts can be applied to real-world database design tasks, ensuring data integrity and improving query performance. Understanding these relationships will help me organize and structure databases effectively in current or future projects.
