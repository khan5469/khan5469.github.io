    <p>In session 8 i learend a lot of new things which i also implied on my studeies. During this activity I utilized both W3C Markup Validation Service and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to assess HTML code correctness and identify accessibility barriers in web pages.
    The web page had to pass this examination to verify proper construction for universal accessibility including People with Disabilities. I discovered that correct and clean HTML code is vital since
    coding errors confuse assistive tools which consequently hinder users from understanding or utilizing the page through screen readers. The evaluation tool WAVE alerts users to picture ALT text
    deficiencies and hard-to-distinguish colors since these issues create accessibility barriers for vision-impaired site visitors. 
    Through this exercise I gained knowledge about how enhanced accessibility benefits all website users. The skills I gained during this project will help me test my web pages using similar tools
    and address their detected issues in upcoming projects. My website development skills will improve through this practice to create interfaces which maintain basic easy use for everyone.</p>
