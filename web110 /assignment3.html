    <p>The third session provided extensive information about search engine functionality. The correlation between domain names and HTML fields enables search engines to establish page indexes as well
    as find the most suitable web page for a given query. Domain names serve as organizational tools for web pages since they offer names that clarify what content each domain contains. HTML fields like
    title tags along with meta descriptions as well as headings and alt attributes receive analysis for determining web page structure and meaning. The search engine system breaks text into word sections
    known as tokens before it matches these tokens to specific keywords and related topics. The indexing system makes results retrieval simpler because it enables relevance-based web page ranking.The search
    engine processes information by dividing its content into smaller word units known as tokens to generate topic or keyword connections. A massive well-organized index storage maintains search engine tokens
    which allows quick access to ranking web pages according to search query significance. Search engines analyze algorithmically two sets of factors to evaluate page rankings in search results including keyword
    frequencies and quality standards along with linked references. The complete information retrieval system allows users to obtain both precise and appropriate data at maximum speed.As im going in the fiedl of 
    marketing serach engines are going to e the most Im gonna use to deal with advertising and I would love to have a competition for google which is actually better than google.</p>
