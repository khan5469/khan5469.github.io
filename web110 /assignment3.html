<p>In the first activity, I utilized Google and Bing and Yahoo and Ask to search for "web search engine" in this activity. This website sought to analyze how search engine results appeared alongside their
interfaces together with their information relevance. I discovered the search engines use distinct approaches to show their results to users. The Google search returned appropriate content
together with a knowledge panel and ideas section while Bing offered an aesthetically pleasing search experience through its image-focused search elements. Users could find similar outcomes
between Yahoo and Bing but Yahoo failed to deliver organized results and Ask customized its search results through question queries. The assignment demonstrated to me that search engines
use different methods to improve user experience by adapting to individual requirements. The concept enables me to select appropriate search engines depending on the project need where
I use Google for intensive research while Bing suits visual needs.
In the Second activity, I learned to enhance search outcomes by applying Boolean operators consisting of AND, OR and NOT during this activity. I obtained relevant articles about search engines in relation to SEO when
I conducted a search for "search engine" AND "SEO." The search engine "search engine" OR "SEO" expanded the results to display content related to either term. I included the Boolean operator NOT
to eliminate search results about Google when using "search engine." The Boolean search methods taught me an efficient way to limit search results so I can find desired information quickly. The
obtained skill will enable me to retrieve accurate data in academic and professional settings ensuring I obtain the most appropriate and reliable source content efficiently.Through these search
tasks I developed improved knowledge of search engine operations and innovative search strategies that benefit my everyday work activities.</p>
