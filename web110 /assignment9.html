    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>
    <p>In session 9 I learned that CSS functions are used as a styling solution for web page formatting through its role as Cascading Style Sheets tool. Through CSS developers can control multiple
    elements such as text colors and fonts and the layout design alongside spacing distribution which leads to well-designed organized websites. Web Style Sheets (CSS) functions as an
    HTML styling tool through three utilization methods which consist of direct element application (inline), in-line styles placed within <style> HTML tags (internal) and external use
    which stores CSS in separate files. The application of external CSS becomes especially beneficial because it enables web pages to use common style definitions which reduces development
    time and work. The.ast part of CSS enables websites to automatically adapt their presentation while still maintaining a good appearance across various screen conditions. Web development
    becomes more efficient because CSS enables developers to divide design elements from content sections.</p>
