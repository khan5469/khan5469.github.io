  <h1>Assignment 12: SQL Commands and Relational Databases</h1>

  <h2>SQL Commands</h2>
  <p>Below are the SQL commands used in this session, displayed as an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SELECT:</strong> Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.</li>
    <li><strong>WHERE:</strong> Filters records based on specified conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>COUNT:</strong> Returns the number of rows matching a condition.</li>
    <li><strong>INSERT INTO:</strong> Adds new records to a table.</li>
    <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Modifies existing records in a table.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary Paragraph</h2>
  <p>
    This session tells a lot about how database comprises organized data while a relational database uses tables and schemas as well as additional elements to maintain its structure.
    A Database Management System works as software through which users handle databases for storage and administration and data analysis tasks. Among
    the notable DBMS options are MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite and Oracle Database. Data management and querying within most relational databases
    occurs through the implementation of SQL (Structured Query Language). The SELECT command in SQL enables administrators to select data while record
    insertion and modification tasks use UPDATE and DELETE commands. A database retrieves specific rows through the Where clause conditions and determines
    result order operation using the Order by clause. The Join command in SQL creates a combined data output from different database table queries. All
    queries enable the retrieval of all database columns while each statement requires a terminating semicolon. The specific order output in databases 
    requires explicit sorting because SQL serves as a formidable tool for controlling relational data management.
