    <p>In session 8 we learn about HTML. Web pages together with applications get built by using HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language as its standard language. Through
    HTML documents web browsers convert computer information into multimedia web pages. Web pages get structured through HTML while tags written as angle bracket expressions define
    visual elements including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images and beyond. HTML tags assist browsers to show content properly though they do not display the tags to users.
    The current standard HTML5 since 2014 enables developers to embed images together with forms and JavaScript scripts as well as interactive elements into web pages. Content appearance
    and layout throughout the pages function through CSS in accordance with the W3C recommendations.
    HTML tags function as paired elements that need open and close marks but there are also self-nesting elements that include tags. A standard HTML file starts with a DOCTYPE declaration followed by html tags which encompass a head section containing metadata and a body section
    for displayable content. The emphasis in Semantic HTML is on meaningful content rather than styles because it replaces outdated presentational elements with CSS-based approaches.
    The symbols < and > need to be written through code syntax that displays. Web page structure and accessibility develop through basic understanding of these HTML conventions.</p>
